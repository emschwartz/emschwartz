Hi üëã, I'm Evan Schwartz.

I'm an ideas person, aspiring inventor, and software engineer (Rust/Typescript).

When in a new environment, system, or company, I try to find what the most important problem is and then dive into working on it. My favorite thing is finding simple, clever solutions to apparently complex problems and then taking them from idea to reality. I also enjoy building community, giving presentations, and trying to explain ideas in ways that are easy to understand.

The three most significant projects I've worked on thus far are [Autometrics](#autometrics), [TurboVPB and Turbo Phonebank](#turbovpb--turbo-phonebank), and [Interledger](#interledger) (see below for the details, recorded presentations, and blog posts on each).

Outside of this, I spend time [reading](#reading) about political economy (among many other topics), running, cooking, sometimes making ceramics.


## Projects

### Autometrics

[Autometrics](https://github.com/autometrics-dev) is a set of open source libraries that make it easy to understand how code is performing in production. It enables developers to instrument functions with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) metrics to track the request rate, error rate, and latency of any function. The fun part is that they also insert links to live charts directly into each function's documentation so developers can jump directly from their editors to looking at the performance of their system in realtime (watch the demo [here](https://github.com/autometrics-dev)).

I came up with the initial idea for Autometrics while working at [Fiberplane](https://fiberplane.com) on how to make observability more accessible and appealing to developers. I built the first implementation in Rust ([autometrics-rs](https://github.com/autometrics-dev/autometrics-rs)) and have been collaborating with other developers inside and outside of the company to develop the concept further and create libraries in different programming languages.

### TurboVPB & Turbo Phonebank

While taking time off in-between jobs, I got involved with the [Sunrise Movement](https://www.sunrisemovement.org/) doing phonebanking for climate-focused, progressive political candidates in the US. I was frustrated by how manual some of the phone calling platforms were and decided to build a browser extension, [TurboVPB](https://turbovpb.com), to speed up these calls.

I'm proud to say that TurboVPB has been used to place more than 5 million calls and send more than 500,000 text messages -- and counting.

Based on the experience of building this browser extension, I also built a standalone phonebanking platform called [Turbo Phonebank](https://turbophonebank.com) (using Typescript, Preact, Supabase, and Vercel). This has been used to contact more than 50,000+ people.

### Interledger

[Interledger](https://interledger.org) is a protocol for routing money across payment networks, akin to packet switching on the internet. While working at [Ripple](https://ripple.com), the then-CTO, Stefan Thomas, and I co-invented Interledger to enable interoperability between disparate financial networks and ledgers. I helped develop the [initial concept](https://interledger.org/interledger.pdf), [core protocols](https://github.com/interledger/rfcs), [reference implementation](https://github.com/interledgerjs) in Typescript, and then led the [reimplementation in Rust](https://github.com/interledger/interledger-rs). I currently serve on the board of the Interledger Foundation.
